For my final project I focused on building a 3D scene by combining basic geometric shapes to form more complex structures. I was able to construct objects that resemble real world features such as playground equipment, benches, trees and other outdoor elements by using simple elements like boxes, cones, cylinders and pyramids. This process taught me how flexible basic shapes can be when they are intentionally arranged and transformed. In addition to the shape transformation, I implemented lighting and textures to improve the scene's realism. Lighting brought dimension and mood to the environment, while textures added detail without increasing geometric complexity. This project helped me sharpen my design eye and creativity; it also gave me experience working with transformations, lighting  and texture mapping. These tecniques are useful for future educational and professional work involving digital design, simulations or visualization. This process helped me gain a better understanding about how computational graphics allow us to express visually.
